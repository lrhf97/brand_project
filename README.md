# brand_project
This is an exploration of the twitter api to pull followers and analyze their location, bios, retweets to create data that can lead to targeted branding... 

right now I am going through the motions to see what and how I can pull things and the next step is to make a plan to put it all together.

any questions or advice are welcome.

Alex
